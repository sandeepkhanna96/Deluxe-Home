# Sandeep Khanna – CAD Designer Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate and detail-oriented CAD Designer with experience in 3D modeling, architectural visualization, and technical drawing. Below, I showcase a multi-story residential building project to demonstrate my design process from conceptualization to final rendering.

## Project: Multi-Story Residential Building

### 1. Real-World Inspiration

The initial inspiration for this project comes from urban residential architecture, focusing on efficient land usage and modern aesthetics.

### 2. 3D CAD Model

Using industry-standard CAD software, I developed a detailed 3D model of the building. The model emphasizes realistic proportions, façade details, and balcony structures.

### 3. Technical Drawing & CAD Visualization

For technical accuracy, I generated a clean CAD visualization. This view illustrates the structural layout, floor divisions, and balcony arrangements, suitable for design documentation and construction reference.
